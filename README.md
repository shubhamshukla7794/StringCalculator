# String Calculator Program


This program is based on the question given by Roy Osherove in the [Link](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1).

This program is developed using Test Driven Development approach.
The program takes a string which contains a set of numbers differentiated by delimiters.
The default delimiters are **','** and **'\n'**.
One can also set their custom delimiters also.
Some example of such acceptable cases are :

```
10,20,40,7
10,10\n50
//;\n1;2
//[***]\n10***20***40
//[*][%]\n25*30%15
//[**][%%]\n15**25%%37

```

I have achived this two approches which are in Version 1 and 2 respectively.
